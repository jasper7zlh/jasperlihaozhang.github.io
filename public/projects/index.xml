      <description>Supervised Learning Project: Finding Donors for CharityML Getting Started In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals&amp;rsquo; income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000.</description>

      <description>Model Evaluation &amp;amp; Validation Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices Getting Started In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value.</description>
